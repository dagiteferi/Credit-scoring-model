# Understanding Credit Scores and Microloans

Credit scores are numerical representations that gauge how likely an individual is to repay a loan and make timely payments. Essentially, they predict one's credit behavior—such as the likelihood of paying back loans on time—using information from credit reports.loans typically given to borrowers who lack collateral. These financial tools provide a crucial lifeline for those with limited access to traditional lending resources.
# Role of Data in Credit Scoring

Data play an important role in the development, monitoring, and maintenance of credit scoring models. By utilizing data, these models gain higher predictive power and deeper insights, which allow financial institutions to offer new products to previously excluded sectors of society, granting them access to affordable credit.
### Types of Data Used for Credit Scoring

Traditionally, credit data are utilized for credit scoring, which include the following:

- **Amount of Loan**: The total sum borrowed.
- **Type of Loan**: Categories such as personal, mortgage, auto, etc.
- **Maturity of Loan**: The duration until the loan is fully repaid.
- **Guarantees and Collateral Value**: Assets pledged to secure the loan.
- **Historical Payment Performance**: Records of default information and payments in arrears.
- **Amounts Owed**: The current outstanding debt.
- **Length of Credit History**: The duration of a borrower's credit activity.
- **New Credit**: Recent credit inquiries and accounts.
- **Types of Credit**: The variety of credit accounts held, such as credit cards, retail accounts, installment loans, etc.

These data points are factored into a credit score as indicators of the borrower’s willingness and ability to repay their debts.

### Modern Credit Scoring Systems

Modern credit scoring systems can collate data from a wide variety of sources in structured, unstructured, and semi-structured forms. New data sources include granular spending behavior, mobile data, geolocation data, and payment data from utilities and, in some cases, social media.

#### Mobile Data
Mobile applications may collect data such as transport movements, geolocation, and transactional data. This data allows mobile phone applications to perform credit checks that traditional credit scoring providers (CSPs) may find challenging. However, data subjects may be unaware that their personal data is used for credit scoring.

#### Social Media Data
Research suggests that the number and frequency of social media posts can provide insights into consumers' lifestyles, expenditures, and willingness to repay debt.
